# Code & results for simulations of our time-varying precision-weighted multi-source evidence accumulation model

This repository houses all code related to the model first described in Khoudary, Peters*, Bornstein* (2022) [_Precision-weighted evidence integration predicts time-varying influence of memory on perceptual decisions_](https://aaron.bornstein.org/cv/pubs/2022_kpb_ccn.pdf), published as a conference proceeding in Computational Cognitive Neuroscience.

The model continues to be updated for different use cases. Code and data needed to reproduce figures reported in different outlets can be found in dedicated subdirectories. The main branch of the repo contains the most up-to-date code. As of 07/28/2024, the code in this branch is being used to perform simulations to guide piloting of a novel behavioral experiment developed to directly test the model.
